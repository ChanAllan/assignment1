Programming Background
When I began the CS program I was new to programming. The project that I enjoyed
working on was the final project in CS161 since it was a project of our choice
and it allowed me to showcase my new coding skills that I learned in the course. 
The final project that I did was a quiz on marine biology facts and also determined
a quiz score. 

My favorite project in CS162 was the Conway's Game of Life implementation. It was
a difficult program to code, but there were many different scenarios that we could
make with different patterns. It was fun to create our own simulations.
