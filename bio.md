My name is Allan.
I am a Lakers and a Blazers fan.
I like going to the beach and playing basketball and tennis.




Programming Background
When I began the CS program I was new to programming. The project that I enjoyed
working on was the final project in CS161 since it was a project of our choice
and it allowed me to showcase my new coding skills that I learned in the course. 
The final project that I did was a quiz on marine biology facts and also determined
a quiz score.
